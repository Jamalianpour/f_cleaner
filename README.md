# Flutter Cleaner (f_cleaner) üßπ

A Dart CLI tool that automatically scans directories for Flutter projects and runs `flutter clean` to free up disk space.

## The Problem

Flutter projects accumulate large build directories that consume significant disk space. Manually cleaning each project becomes tedious when you're working on multiple projects.

## The Solution

This tool automatically:
- Scans directories to identify Flutter projects
- Calculates build directory sizes
- Runs `flutter clean` on each project
- Reports total space freed

## Features

- Parallel Cleaning: Processes multiple projects simultaneously for speed
- Non-intrusive: Only cleans build directories, leaving your source code untouched
- Space Reporting: Shows exactly how much space you've reclaimed
- Dry Run Mode: Preview what would be cleaned without making changes
- Safety Confirmation: Confirm before cleaning with detailed information
- Configurable: Control recursion depth, verbosity, and confirmation prompts

## Installation
You can install flutter cleaner CLI from github repository or pub.dev:
```bash
# From Github
dart pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/Jamalianpour/f_cleaner.git

# From Pub.dev
dart pub global activate f_cleaner
```

Or install and active it from source code:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f_cleaner.git
cd f_cleaner

# Install dependencies
dart pub get

# Activate the CLI tool globally
dart pub global activate --source path .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Clean Flutter projects in current directory and subdirectories
f_cleaner

# Clean Flutter projects in a specific directory
f_cleaner --dir=/path/to/your/flutter/projects

# Non-recursive scan
f_cleaner --dir=/path/to/projects --no-recursive

# Dry run (scan and report but don't clean)
f_cleaner --dry-run

# Skip confirmation prompt
f_cleaner --no-confirm

# Show detailed output
f_cleaner --verbose

# Show help
f_cleaner --help
```

## Example Output
